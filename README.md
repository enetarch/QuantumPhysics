# QuantumPhysics
An introduction to quantum physics written by an ADHDr with Dyslexia for others in the same boat.  I'm not a PhD, and am cobbling material from other books as I figure it out.  Help to explain concepts would be appreciated.

The book is split purposefully between left and right facing pages.
On the left is the discussion of quantum phyiscs in a natural language.
On the right is the math.  

The reason why this is done, is becuase dyslexics cant switch between natural language and math fluidly.  In addition, dyslexics can't see changes to mathematical equations when they are seperated by natural language.  Also, dyslexics can't see changes to mathematical statements that are written in lenticular format.  

This book needs a conventions section describing several more conventions that I've taken.  

Problems and examples need to be added to the book.  Any problem added to a chapter of the book needs to make sure that the problem is dicussed fully in the chapter.  It should not be left to the reader to derive material.  One of the hardest parts of Quantum Physics is that I find other books leave parts unanswered and expect the reader to figure it out on their own, without providing the strategy to solve the problem.  Note, the strategy can be in natural language, and should reference in detail the steps to solve a problem.

I am trying to discuss a concept in several formats .. natural language, picto graphic and mathematical.  This means describing the tools, strategies, and examples using these 3 modes, while encoraging the reader to practice and play with the tools.  As with all mathematical problems, the idea is to not only to arrive at the answer, but to prove that each mathematical statement is correct.  As an example, I turn to geometry, where everything is proven using mathematical statements in natural language with axioms and theorems.
